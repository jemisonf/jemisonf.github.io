  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm originally from Portland, OR. Currently I live and work in Corvallis, OR
    at Oregon State University. I currently work at OSU Enterprise Computing
    Services as a student programmer, building node.js APIs for accessing OSU
    data. Previously, I was a student programmer at the OSU Library, where I
    mainly work on Drupal sites doing design work, theming, and automation. In
    the past, I've worked on Rails web application development.
  </p>

  <p>Here are some cool stacks I've worked with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Spinnaker</strong> and
      <strong>New Relic</strong> when working with the
      <a href="projects/newrelic_spinnaker">Spinnaker Monitoring Daemon</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, and
      <strong>React.js</strong> during my internship at New Relic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jquery</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> in
      <a href="projects/tresbien">tresbien</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>React</strong>, <strong>D3</strong>, and <strong>Rails</strong> in
      <a href="https://github.com/osulp/libnav-rails">LibNav</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, and
      <strong>Docker</strong> in <a href="projects/msgr">msgr</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Drupal</strong> in the
      <a href="https://github.com/osulp/osupress-theme"
        >OSU Press Website Rebuild</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>C#.NET</strong> in the
      <a href="projects/htmlfilestripper">Zapproved Customer Success tooling</a>
      I built in summer 2018
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jekyll</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong> in
      <a href="projects/fgj.codes">this website</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I've also used
    <a href="https://github.com/osulp/wwdl-php7/tree/ohs-stable_2_3/.circleci"
      >CircleCI</a
    >
    for continuous deployment on several projects. I'm currently learning
    <strong>Rust</strong>, which I'm hoping to use in an actual project someday
    once I have the ownership system figured out.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2018, I worked at <a href="https://zapproved.com">Zapproved</a> as a
    Customer Success engineering intern. Last summer, I worked at
    <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> a build and deploy tools
    engineering intern. Next year, I'll be returning to New Relic as a full
    stack software engineer.
