<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    I'm originally from Portland, OR. 
    Currently I live and work in Corvallis, OR at Oregon State University. 
    I'm a student programmer at the OSU Library, where I mainly work on Drupal sites doing design work, theming, and automation.
    In the past, I've worked on Rails web application development.
</p>

<p>Here are some cool stacks I've worked with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Jquery</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> in <a href="projects/tresbien">tresbien</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>React</strong>, <strong>D3</strong>, and <strong>Rails</strong> in <a href="https://github.com/osulp/libnav-rails">LibNav</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, and <strong>Docker</strong> in <a href="projects/msgr">msgr</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drupal</strong> in the <a href="https://github.com/osulp/osupress-theme">OSU Press Website Rebuild</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>C#.NET</strong> in the <a href="projects/htmlfilestripper">Zapproved Customer Success tooling</a> I built in summer 2018
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Jekyll</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong> in <a href="projects/fgj.codes">this website</a>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    I've also used <a href="https://github.com/osulp/wwdl-php7/tree/ohs-stable_2_3/.circleci">CircleCI</a> for continuous deployment on several projects.
    I'm currently learning <strong>Rust</strong>, which I'm hoping to use in an actual project someday once I have the ownership system figured out.
</p>

<p>
    Last summer, I worked at <a href="https://zapproved.com">Zapproved</a> as a Customer Success engineering intern. Next summer, I'm joining <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> a tools engineering intern.
