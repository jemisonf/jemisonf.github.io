<p>
    I'm originally from Portland, OR. 
    I learned to program in high school with Java and Python, and continued studying computer science in college at Oregon State University in 2016. 
    Currently, I'm working as a student programmer as the OSU library's Department of Emerging Technologies and Services. 
    Previously, I've been a Custom Success Engineering Intern at <a href="https://zapproved.com">Zapproved</a>, and I'll be joining <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> as a Tools Engineering Intern next summer.
