    I'm originally from Portland, OR. 
    Right now, I'm a student at Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR studying computer science, where I also work as a student programmer as the OSU library's Department of Emerging Technologies and Services. 
    Previously, I've been a Custom Success Engineering Intern at <a href="https://zapproved.com">Zapproved</a>, and I'll be joining <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> as a Tools Engineering Intern in summer 2019.
