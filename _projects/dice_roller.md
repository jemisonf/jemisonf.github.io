Some background: Shadowrun is a cyperpunk pencil-and-paper role playing game, a little like Dungeons and Dragons. To determine if a Shadowrun character succeeds at an action they're attempting to do, you roll a "dice pool" of six-sided dice and count the number of fives and sixes, called "hits". This is different from D&D, where you generally only roll one die to check if an action succeeds. Because dice pools can get really big--upwards of 10 dice is not unsual--lots of people use online dice rollers instead of physical dice.

The problem with these dice rollers is that a lot of them are really bad; they're either slow, or really badly designed, or both. So I decided to make my own, with three goals:

1. Have a simple, clean look
3. Be fast and lightweight
2. Be mobile and desktop friendly.

1 and 2 were top priorities, and 3 was a stretch goal. You can see the result [here](https://fgj.codes/dice_roller). 1 and 2 definitely succeeded; the site scores a 100 on a Lighthouse performance audit, and the visible elements have been reduced to the bare essentials. 3 is mostly true; the site is usable on mobile, but the controls for selecting number of dice are a work in progress. I'm also proud to say that the site shows up on the first page of google when you search ["Shadowrun dice roller"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=shadowrun+dice+roller). Here's a screenshot of the app:
