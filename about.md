# About Me

I'm a software engineer on the Build and Deploy Tools team at New Relic, Inc. I work on internal tooling to enable New Relic engineers to build, test, and deploy their software using our managed CI/CD platform.

Personally, I'm passionate about building fast and reliable software everywhere in the stack. My main areas of focus are **Go** and **Javascript**, and I've built software on top of **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Kubernetes**. This blog is hosted on Github Pages and monitored with **New Relic Browser**.
