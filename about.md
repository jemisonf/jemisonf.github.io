title: About Me
---

I'm a software engineer on the backend team at <a href="https://jeli.io">Jeli</a>. I'm excited to be bringing expertise in CI/CD, container orchestration, and reliability to a team building the platform to support next-generation incident analysis tools.

Personally, I'm passionate about building fast and reliable software everywhere in the stack. The primary languages I've worked in are **Go**, **Python**, and **Javascript**, and I've built software on top of **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Kubernetes**. This blog is hosted on Github Pages and monitored with **New Relic Browser**.
